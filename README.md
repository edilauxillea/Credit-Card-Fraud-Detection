# Introduction
Credit card fraud is a significant concern for financial institutions and individuals. Detecting fraudulent transactions in a timely manner is crucial to minimize financial losses. This project aims to build a credit card fraud detection system using machine learning techniques.

The system is designed to analyze historical credit card transaction data and identify patterns indicative of fraud. By training a machine learning model on a labeled dataset, the system can learn to recognize fraudulent transactions based on various features such as transaction amount, location, time, etc.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is not included in this repository due to its large size. 
However, I've given the link for the dataset here - [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud?resource=download&select=creditcard.csv) 

# Installation
To set up the environment for running this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: 
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory: 
```
cd Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
```
3. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
4. Install the required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Usage
1. Ensure that you have loaded the dataset.
2. Run the 'Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection.ipynb' script.
```
jupyter Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection
```
3. This will load the dataset, train the model, and generate predictions for a sample set of transactions.
The script will output the predicted labels for the sample transactions, indicating whether they are fraudulent or not.

# Preprocessing
Before training a model, the dataset needs to be preprocessed. Follow these steps for preprocessing:
1. Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
2. Explore the data and handle any missing values or anomalies.
3. Scale the numerical features to a standard range.
4. Encode categorical features using one-hot encoding or label encoding.
5. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

# Model Training
This project utilizes machine learning algorithms for fraud detection. The steps for training a model are as follows:
1. Select an appropriate machine learning algorithm, such as logistic regression or random forest.
2. Initialize the model with suitable hyperparameters.
3. Train the model using the preprocessed training data.
4. Optimize the model by tuning hyperparameters using techniques like cross-validation.
5. Save the trained model for future use.

# Evaluation
To evaluate the performance of the trained model, follow these steps:
1. Load the saved model.
2. Process the preprocessed testing data.
3. Use the model to predict fraud labels for the testing data.
4. Calculate relevant metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
5. Analyze the results and interpret the model's performance.
