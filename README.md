# Introduction
Credit card fraud is a significant concern for financial institutions and individuals. Detecting fraudulent transactions in a timely manner is crucial to minimize financial losses. This project aims to build a credit card fraud detection system using machine learning techniques.

The system is designed to analyze historical credit card transaction data and identify patterns indicative of fraud. By training a machine learning model on a labeled dataset, the system can learn to recognize fraudulent transactions based on various features such as transaction amount, location, time, etc.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is not included in this repository due to its large size. However, it can be obtained from reliable sources such as Kaggle or UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset should contain a sufficient number of labeled examples, with features including transaction details and a binary label indicating fraud or non-fraud.
